# Apple Shortcuts

A repo for versioning my apple shortcut scripts as I build them. 

This project relies on [shortcut-js](https://github.com/joshfarrant/shortcuts-js) to craft apple shortcuts for iOS.

### Usage
- Run `npm run build` to build the scripts into .shortcut files ready to use. Built files will live in `./dist`
- Each file inside of the `./src` directory is assumed to be an individual shortcut.
